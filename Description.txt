Project: ShopWorld

ShopWorld is a modern e-commerce platform designed to sell a wide variety of products 
across multiple categories. The project includes both the backend and frontend, 
developed using Laravel for the backend and Vue 3 for the frontend, ensuring a 
seamless and efficient user experience.

Backend (Laravel):

The backend is built with Laravel, a powerful PHP framework known for its scalability 
and robust features. It handles all the core functionalities of the platform, including 
user authentication, product management, order processing, and payment integration. 
The system is designed to handle a large volume of transactions, providing a secure 
and reliable environment for both users and administrators.

Frontend (Vue 3):

The frontend is developed using Vue 3, a progressive JavaScript framework that enables 
dynamic and responsive user interfaces. The platform features an intuitive, mobile-friendly 
design that allows customers to browse and purchase items easily. With Vue 3â€™s reactivity 
and component-based architecture, the user experience is smooth and interactive, from 
browsing products to completing checkout.
